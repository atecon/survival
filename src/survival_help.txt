This package is supposed to become a collection of methods applicable to event data. It currently includes the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator.

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS
================

kaplanmeier(const series y, const series censored, const bundle opts)
==================================================================
Function executing the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The variance is computed via Greenwood's (1926) approximation.

Input parameters
    y:            series, Endogenous holding observed survival times
    censored:     series, Boolean being unity if the i-th subject was right
                  censored, otherwise zero
    opts:         bundle, Pass user-specific options. Currently supported:
                  - ci_level: scalar, width of the confidence interval
                             between 0 and 1 (default: 0.95)


Return: Bundle holding various information:

    ci_level:        scalar, width of the confidence interval (default: 0.95)
    lower:           matrix, Tx1 vector of the lower bound confidence interval
    n_events:        matrix, Tx1 vector referring to the number of failed
                     subjects (after removing censored ones) at time t
    n_subjects:      matrix, Tx1 vector referring to the number of subjects at
                     risk (after removing censored ones) at time t
    periods:         matrix, Tx1 vector of sorted distinct periods each
                     referring to time t
    stderror:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated standard errors of the
                     survivor function at time t
    survival:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated survival probabilities at
    upper:           matrix, Tx1 vector of the upper bound confidence interval
    variance:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated variance at time t


print_kaplanmeier(const bundle model)
==================================================================
Print estimation results for each time period t.

Input parameters
    model:        bundle, Bundle holding estimation results as returned by the
                  kaplanmeier() function call

Return: Nothing


plot_kaplanmeier(const bundle model, const bundle opts)
==================================================================
Print estimation results for each time period t.

Input parameters
    model:        bundle, Bundle holding estimation results as returned by the
                  kaplanmeier() function call
    opts:         bundle, Optional arguments passed for tweaking or storing the
                  compiled plot. The supported arguments currently are:
                  - filename: Specify full path plus filename for storing plot

Return: Nothing
