This package is supposed to become a collection of methods applicable to survival data. It currently includes the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator.

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS

kaplanmeier(const series y, const series censored)
==================================================================
Function executing the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The variance is computed via Greenwood's (1926) approximation.

Input parameters
    y:            series, Endogenous holding observed survival times
    censored:     series, Boolean being unity if i-th subject was right
                  censored, otherwise zero


Return: Bundle holding various information:

    ci_level:        scalar, width of the confidence interval
    lower:           matrix, Tx1 vector of the lower bound confidence interval
                     to either an event (failed subjects) or censoring
    n_events_at_t:   matrix, Tx1 vector referring to the number of failed
                     subjects (without censored ones) at time t
    n_subjects_at_t: matrix, Tx1 vector referring to the number of subjects at
                     risk (after censoring) at time t
    periods:         matrix, Tx1 vector of sorted distinct periods each
                     referring time t
    stderror:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated standard error of the
                     survivor function at time t
    survival:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated survival probabilities at
    upper:           matrix, Tx1 vector of the upper bound confidence interval
    variance:        matrix, Tx1 vector of estimated standard variance at time t


print_kaplanmeier(const bundle model)
==================================================================
Print estimation results for each time period t.

Input parameters
    model:        bundle, Bundle holding estimation results as returned by the
                  kaplanmeier() function call

Return: Nothing


plot_kaplanmeier(const bundle model, const bundle opts)
==================================================================
Print estimation results for each time period t.

Input parameters
    model:        bundle, Bundle holding estimation results as returned by the
                  kaplanmeier() function call
    opts:         bundle, Optional arguments passed for tweaking or storing the
                  compiled plot. The supported arguments currently are:
                  - filename: Specify full path plus filename for storing plot

Return: Nothing
